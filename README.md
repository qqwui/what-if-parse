# what-if-parse
A python script that downloads xkcd What If articles to .txt files

This script downloads all the what-if articles, parses them with BeautifulSoup and replaces common unicode chars with their ascii equivilents, outputting a plain text file.
The website has changed many times and could again, making this script useless.
Also this script will place its output on the same directory as the script itself, so it's recommended you run this in its own directory.
